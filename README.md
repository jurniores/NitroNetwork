# ðŸ”¥ NitroNetwork - Unity Networking Framework

**NitroNetwork** is a lightweight and fast networking solution for Unity, designed to simplify multiplayer development while offering flexibility and control for both client and server behaviors.

This repository contains an example implementation of a basic connection flow between client and server using `NitroBehaviour`, `NitroStatic`, and `NitroRPC`.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Example: `ConnectPeers.cs`

This script demonstrates how to automatically connect a client to the server when the scene starts. It also shows how to use RPCs to send messages between peers.

### âœ… Features:
- Uses `[NitroRPC(NitroType.Server)]` to call a server-only method from the client.
- Ensures the object exists in all peers using `NitroStatic`.
- Inherits from `NitroBehaviour` to enable network features.

### ðŸ“„ Script

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

// Requires the NitroStatic component so this object is always present in the scene across all peers.
[RequireComponent(typeof(NitroStatic))]
public partial class ConnectPeers : NitroBehaviour
{
    // Called once before the first Update() after the object is initialized.
    // Automatically tries to connect to the server when the scene starts.
    void Start()
    {
        CallConnectToServer(); // This will send an RPC to the server.
    }

    // Called every frame. Not used in this example.
    void Update()
    {
        
    }

    // RPC method that will be executed on the server when called by a client.
    [NitroRPC(NitroType.Server)]
    void ConnectToServer()
    {
        Debug.Log("ConnectToServer");
        // Handle player registration or initialization here.
    }
}
